# DONE

## By 25th Apr 2016

- ✅ can connect Tty to World
  - ✅ namespace `JshCli`
  - ✅ cli/src/world/core.js exists
  - ✅ can provide profile and env to `<Jsh>`
    - ✅ extend schema
    - ✅ extend bootstrap
  - ✅ complete `awaitWorld`
```sh
import core
awaitWorld
```

- ✅ can spawn npc via `w.npc.spawn({ npcKey, point })`
- ✅ tty supports `w` via `CACHE_SHORTCUTS`
- ✅ can spawn from tty
```sh
w npc.spawn '{ npcKey: "rob", point: [0, 0, 0] }'
w npc.remove rob && w update
expr '{ npcKey: "rob", point: [0, 0, 0] }' | w npc.spawn -
```

- ✅ fix disappearing WorldMenu on resize Tabs whilst other tab open
- ✅ can pick npcs
- ✅ npc has label quad
- ✅ on drag unseen tab onto grid it should mount
- ✅ `pick` event provides intersection

- ✅ `click` -> `pick` command
- ✅ `pick` command provides top-level distance, point, face (not in intersection)

- ✅ sh parse error `echo $( pick 1 | map point )`
- ✅ can programatically spawn
```sh
w npc.spawn "{ npcKey: 'foo-bar-baz', point: $( pick 1 | map point ) }"
```
- ✅ can await spawn

- ✅ spawn adds agent to crowd when `w.nav` exists
- ✅ BUG `npc.agentId` becomes `null` on HMR
- ✅ respawn compatible with crowd
- ✅ can `w npc.move "{ npcKey: 'rob', to: $( pick 1 ) }"`
  - no walk/run animation yet

- ✅ tweak walking until its cleaner
  - ✅ unify pinning as `w.npc.pinTo`

  - ✅ walk loop shell script
```sh
# keep walking without throwing
spawn npc:rob at:$( pick 1 )
while true; do
  move --force npc:rob to:$( pick meta.floor 1 )
done
```
  - ✅ basic stuck detection

- ✅ can ignore throw inside while somehow
  - decided against `foo || true` because `foo` might write to stderr
  - ✅ support e.g. `move --force npc:rob to:$( pick 1 )`

- ✅ import `crowd` from `navcat/blocks` and `crowd.update(agents, navMesh, clampedDeltaTime)`
- ✅ change ui `Global` to `Layout`

  - ❌ layout schema and layouts.json
    - can CRUD in DEV

- ✅ when resizing always show cancel button

## By 17th Apr 2016

- ✅ currently must re-run `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` per obstacle polygon change
  - 🔔 triangle in `console--019--2x2` whose rect extension exposes part of a chair
  - could automate this... we still avoid "changing spritesheet problem"
  - ✅ assets.json has number `hash.obstacles`
  - ❌ `pnpm gen-assets-json` triggers `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` onchange hash.obstacles
    - we'll keep `hash.obstacles` though
  - ✅ support `public/starship-symbol/masks`
    - used when drawing obstacle sprite-sheets
    - ✅ example of mask
    - ✅ in `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` we should account for masks
    - ✅ put restrict to obstacle polys under `--prod`
      - probably should run in a git hook
    - ✅ clean up gen code
    - ✅ run `pnpm gen-starship-sheets --prod` on commit or push
    - ✅ move invert colours to script
    - ✅ can trigger refresh in dev via tanstack query devtools

- ✅ avoid `<Obstacles>` flicker by only uploading to GPU once drawing finished

- ✅ try add shadow quad to skinnedMesh
  - ✅ can export quad as another SkinnedMesh and show
  - ✅ add parent root to Blockbench file: root -> skeleton-root -> ...
  - ✅ augment skinnedMesh geometry with quad so still only one mesh
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ ensure multiple worlds work
  - saw work on desktop
- ✅ can scroll through tabs on mobile
  - first attempt failed i.e. `overflow-x-auto` plus `shrink-0`
- ✅ can drop tab outside Tabs
- ✅ can move UIs inside Tabs
- ✅ unify menu styles
- ✅ default is not empty-map (although still exists)
  - defaultMapKey has value "small-map-0"

- ✅ support object-picking
  - ✅ read pixel on pointer down
  - ✅ mounting `<NPCs>` late seems to fix things?!
  - ✅ Putting `<Suspense>` directly around NPC component seems to fix it
    - `useTexture` took too long?
  - Delay MRT: may want different scene for object-pick e.g. no walls
    - MRT could still be useful for drag-select
  - ✅ Floor/Ceiling/Walls/Obstacles shader support objectPick uniform

- ✅ fix obstacles texture disappearing on remount stuff inside World.tsx
  - hot reload was resetting canvas width/height to 1

- ✅ navmesh should account for doors
  - https://github.com/isaac-mason/navcat/blob/9a8379e05cc28bf842405df214271885046833d8/examples/src/example-doors-and-keys.ts#L201
  - https://github.com/isaac-mason/navcat/blob/9a8379e05cc28bf842405df214271885046833d8/blocks/generators/generate-tiled-nav-mesh.ts
  - ✅ make our own `generateTiledNavMesh` with own `buildNavMeshTile` which "marks door areas"
  - ✅ saw working in untransformed but maybe not transformed geomorphs
  - ✅ better encoding of `(gmId, doorId)`
  - ✅ can run navQuery using queryFilter specifying door areas
    - ✅ `<Debug>` can show instanced navPaths using unit quad
    - ✅ can query navcat and show in `<Debug>`
    - can constrain doorways i.e. areas

- ✅ compute room polygons correctly i.e. need to include doors
  - seems ok already?

- ✅ BUG hull width mismatch
  - demo-map-0 had stale 101 symbol (no offset)

- ✅ show closed Doors using instancedMesh cubes
- ❌ show lintels above Doors

- ✅ some doors have no room to slide
  - ✅ mark them `meta.collapse`
  - ✅ when transform them also scale
  - ✅ adjust UVs so scale does not deform texture

- ❌ on add grid item to UiGrid can we try to use maximum available height and width?

- ✅ for doors try track "openess ratio" via persistent array on gpu
  - https://share.google/aimode/EreUiTQQkX01nIvv2

- ✅ why is boolean uniform `objectPick` being set as `0` after we drag world?
  - because onPointerDown we do another object pick
- ✅ fix remove bug i.e. next tab not set
  - need repro

- ✅ future tabs
  - ✅ try make basic tabs components with draggable tabs
    - https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about
  - ✅ can drag between different tabs components
  - ✅ can drag out of tabs to outside (not another tabs)
  - ❌ can drag into tabs from outer ui
  - ✅ can move component into tabs from outer ui


## By 7th Apr 2016

- ✅ start using `navcat`
  - ✅ add to `ui__world`
  - ✅ create a webworker which can send/receive
  - ✅ generate demo tiled navmesh in webworker
  - ✅ send via serialization

- ✅ construct `w.nav` and show on floor
  - ✅ extract triangles and draw in floor
  - ✅ send event which can be awaited (`nav-updated`)

- ✅ fix hmr onchange geomorphs.ts, const.ts and many others
  - ✅ fix `vite:hmr circular imports detected` (`pnpm dev --debug`)
  - ✅ `@npc-cli/ui-sdk` root only exports types
  - 🔔 issue arises from newly added webworker i.e. it references world/src/const.ts
  - ✅ fix is to send "layout instances" to webworker so it doesn't know about const.ts

- ❌ on edit `geomorph.ts` should rebuild assets and trigger update
  - move request nav worker message to `<WorldWorker>`

- ✅ do not cut doors out of navmesh
- ✅ vite-plugin-watch-assets recomputes assets.json

- ✅ improve HMR onchange tiled-navmesh config
  - ❌ can send config override message
  - ✅ handle hmr in world.worker.ts and inform `<WorldWorker>`

- ✅ support hmr `DerivedGmsData` e.g. can change gmData.tops.nonHull

- ✅ generate spritesheets for symbols reachable by some MapEdit file
  - ✅ `gen-assets-json` stores `assets.stratifiedSymbolNodes`
  - ❌ script `gen-starship-sheets` restricts to leaves in `assets.stratifiedSymbolNodes`
    - we cannot restrict to leaves: we need every symbol containing an "obstacle" polygon
  - ✅ find every non-flattened symbol containing an "obstacle" polygon
  - ✅ script `gen-starship-sheets` generates spritesheet data using `maxrects-packer`
    - ✅ migrate legacy `npc-cli/service/rects-packer.js`
  - ✅ supports multiple sheets (0-based)
  - ✅ sheets.json schema
  - ✅ write sheets.json

- ✅ `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` should also draw the spritesheets
  - ✅ sheets.json entries have sheetId
  - ✅ draw the spritesheets
  - ❌ find a way to restrict bridge--042 image size
    - more obstacles from it will be added
  - ✅ can `pnpm gen-starship-sheets --prod`
    - produces alternative "optimized" texture `.prod.{texId}.png` only drawing obstacle-covered-parts
    - PROD only: smaller download and still have decor cuboid "obstacles"
    - still wastes texture space (memory)

- ✅ MapEdit provide triangle `<path>` for console--019

- ✅ layout.obstacles have
  - ✅ `symbolKey` (string) of original unflattened symbol parent
  - ✅ `transform` for instancedMesh transform
  - ✅ `origSubRect` used to compute UVs
    - `origPoly.rect` offset by `(-bounds.x, -bounds.y)`
    - to compute UVs we'll also need `meta.symbolKey` to lookup `(sheetId, symbolImageCoords)`

- ✅ BUG map origin is not aligned to world origin

- ✅ symbol asset bounds should come from "top image node"
  - ✅ transform.{e,f} should not include offset when snap
    - ✅ confusing (dx, dy) for console--019
    - ✅ console--019 should have transform.{e,f} 0

- ✅ go through existing symbols and fix
- ✅ need symbol `office--001--2x2` instead of `console--019--2x2`
  - "apparent" alignment issues related to some symbol underlays having doors

- ✅ sometimes `Floor` and `Ceiling` fail due to unassigned or mismatched buffer attributes

- ✅ investigate symbol bounds
  - 🔔 clipping to underlay image bounds means outer part of doors not drawn in thumbnail
    - however provides better thumbnail alignment when laying out geomorphs
    - could even consider further restriction to gridRect
  - 🔔 seen symbol alignment improve on re-add symbol to 301
  - ✅ reflection of symbol takes account of node.offset
    - on reflect y/x-axis we negate x/y-offset
  - ✅ `createSymbolFromSavedFile` should not apply `node.offset` to geometry
  - ✅ check other symbols

- ❌ obstacle polygons should be clipped to image node's bounds
  - otherwise they'll be overlap in symbol spritesheet

- ✅ floor/ceiling textures per gmId not per gmKey
  - 🔔 continuous navmesh: cannot assume same triangles for distinct gmKey instances
  - ✅ draw floor as before but per gmId (ceil still per gmKey)
  - ✅ change NavMesh tile triangle test from gridRect to worldBounds
  - ✅ correctly computing triangles in different instances
  - ✅ for the moment let's override hull doorways with a rect
  - ✅ ceilings per gmId too
    - since using same quad as ceiling would need special attribute/uniform

- ✅ MapEdit: map: geomorph symbol not aligned
  - ✅ keep "the space at top" of 301
  - ✅ remove `node.offset` for hull symbols
  - ✅ add offset to respective `<image>` in map
  - ✅ fix it by changing how we compute mapDefs

- ✅ refactor Ceiling
  - ✅ own quad and attributes (don't use w.floor)
  - ✅ texture indexed by gmKey (needs attribute)
  - ✅ test by supplying new hull symbol geomorph

- ✅ fix missing obstacles
  - ✅ related to reflection
  - ✅ can fix via THREE.DoubleSide
  - ❌ fix without using it by flipping based on determinant

- ✅ obstacles
  - ✅ propagate e.g. `meta.y` from symbol into obstacles
  - ✅ hide unused obstacle quads
  - ✅ use textures
  - ✅ issue with triangular part of console capturing nearby chair
    - console--019--2x2
    - ✅ remove `--prod` from `gen-starship-sheets` and always restrict symbols.{texId}.png to obstacles polygons
  - ✅ clean
    - DataArrayTexture
    - `worldToSguScale * 5`

- ✅ BUG webgpu scene sometimes flickers initially and disappears
  - horrendous prod-only 
  - seems fixed by wrapping everthing in `<Suspense>`

- ✅ fix sporadic lighter/darker floor
  - seems fixed via react-three-fiber `<Canvas flat>`
  - ✅ avoid async re-draw (nav could be ready midway)

## By 27th Mar 2016

  - ❌ try convert our SVG symbols into GLTF importable by Blockbench GLTF import plugin
    - Migrating from SVG symbols to Blockbench (free as opposed to BoxySVG)
    - ❌ test generate some valid Blockbench file
      - unclear format
      - https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench-plugins/tree/master/plugins
        - gltf import plugin didn't work
    - ❌ try generate OBJ file and import manually
      - import ignores groups i.e. flat
    - ✅ try programmatically generate gltf and import into blockbench
      - https://gltf-transform.dev/
      - ✅ one cuboid inside a group
      - `pnpm test-gltf-transform`
    - ❌ generate gltf with a texture
      - seem pretty hard if we follow gtlf-transform i.e. weird winding-order
      - instead, try to understand the format exported by blockbench i.e. `cube-exported-from-blockbench`
      - seems everything is stored in a base64-encoded buffer
      - ❌ try to decode that buffer
      - decided against this approach
  - ❌ try create a starship symbol in blockbench
    - inability to support references
  - ✅ add placeholder MapEdit ui

- ✅ MapEdit improvements
  - ✅ fix borders of symbols e.g. zealous trim
    - ✅ apply to cargo
    - ✅ apply to others
  - ✅ scaling snaps to grid but uniform scaling preserves aspect ratio
  - ✅ only one selection rectangle e.g. so visible when object occluded
  - ✅ duplicated object should inherit name prefix
  - ✅ on add rect or image should appear in current viewport

- ✅ figure out correct scaling based on geomorph input files
  - 1x1 sgu (starship geomorph units) ~ 300x300 PNG pixels
  - we scale by 1/5 so 1x1 sgu ~ 60x60 SVG units

- ✅ fix diagonal resize: now covered by absolute?
- ✅ fix disabled toggle inside Tabs

- ✅ more MapEdit
  - ✅ can choose filename to save
  - ✅ can save to file system in dev
  - ✅ try align source PNGs to grid

  - ✅ move dx, dy into image node only
  - ✅ can manually adjust image node offset
  - ✅ can choose save directory `"symbol" | "map"`
    - we won't save svgs but rather "flat symbols" or "maps"
  - ✅ on close image modal without choosing delete image node
  - ✅ dx/dy ui is at top-level
  - ✅ can scroll inspector properly
  - ✅ fix editing id preventing e.g. create rect via `r`
    - seem to happen when select via rectangular area
    - can see node because it remains italic

- ✅ towards type `symbol`
  - need to creates thumbnail for each symbol
  - ✅ organise script into `watch-symbol-thumbs.ts`, `restart-on-fail.sh` and `pnpm -F scripts watch-symbol-thumbs  forever script watches public/symbol`
  - ✅ script watches public/symbol and executes on change
  - ✅ make generic watch-files script i.e.
    > `pnpm restart-on-fail watch-files --globs='[\"packages/app/public/symbol/*.json\"]' --pnpmBin=noop`
  - ❌ try render SVG preview on MapEdit save
    - ✅ use dev endpoint POST /api/map-edit/on-save receives SVG text
    - ❌ symbol/map manifest created on start dev server
      - ✅ server-side svg render
      - ✅ can set width/height in MapEdit
      - ✅ save width/height in file
      - ❌ store svg markup in manifest
  - ✅ /api/map-edit/file/symbol/:filename renders a PNG preview
  
  - ✅ node of type `symbol`

    - ✅ modal with symbol thumbnails
    - ✅ clean
      - ✅ symbolKey should be typed
      - ✅ `rect | image | symbol` e.g. "draggable"

- ✅ locked image/symbol nodes have 25% opacity

- ✅ list files via manifest not dev server
- ✅ generate/get maps manifest too
- ✅ on delete file switch to another file
- ✅ on delete symbol/map update manifest and remove thumbnail
- ✅ map needs thumbnail too


- ✅ 1st "extra" symbol `extra--004--desk--0.5x1`
  - i.e. a symbol that does not comes from starship-symbol PNGs
  - ✅ manually add to packages/media/src/starship-symbol/output/extra
    - npc-cli-next svg -> copy data url
  - ✅ `pnpm starship-pngs-to-public` ensures and extends manifest
  - ✅ can add image to MapEdit

- ✅ renaming imports from process-symbol breaks vite plugin
  - should work now using `server.ssrLoadModule`

- ✅ make symbol for `extra--004--desk--0.5x1`
- ✅ hull symbols "image" should not be scaled down

- ✅ can extend symbol lookup without restarting vite plugin

- ✅ can copy/paste nodes between instances
- ❌ sync files in other instances?
  - can load again in other instance

- ✅ change manifests from byFilename -> byKey
- ✅ manifest entries have `key`
- ✅ increment is `10` by default
  - increment is `1` when press shift (translate) or ctrl (select)

- ✅ align sub-symbol of hull symbol
  - ✅ for symbols need their bounds.width and height
  - dimensions of symbol is wrong
  - e.g. 120x120 originally but thumbnail is larger i.e. use `bounds`

- ❌ restart vite onchange map-edit plugin
  - but we do cache bust imports

## By 7th Feb 2016

    - 🔔 important
  - ✅ copy all left_leg_lower keyframes and:
    - paste on right_leg_lower at `0.5`
    - copy final 3 and paste at `0`
    - remove final 2
    - adjust max time back to `1`
  - ✅ paste over "extra" left_leg_upper keyframe onto right_left_upper shifted +0.5

- ✅ responsive grid layout items as packages/ui/*
  - ✅ packages/ui/demo
  - ✅ packages/ui/demo -> packages/ui/template
  - ✅ scaffold-ui script
    - `pnpm exec scaffold-ui`
  - ✅ packages/ui/blog
    - renders mdx
  - ✅ packages/ui/jsh
  - ✅ packages/ui/global
    - e.g. theme button, layouts
  - ✅ registered somehow inside app
  - ✅ defined by layout

- ✅ theme provided by ui context to uis

- ✅ can lock uis via overlay ui
  - e.g. to fix TtyMenu open/close in mobile
  - ✅ rewrite layout so every item created "in same way"
  - ✅ move borders out of uis
  - ✅ add extra component using phosopher-icons

- ✅ move ui borders outside uis

- ✅ persist UiLayout as "ui-layout"
- ✅ persist UiLayout with itemIdToClientRect
- ✅ initial skeleton (ssg) on refresh via persisted data
- ✅ clean initial skeleton
- ✅ retreive persisted ui-layout

- ✅ normalize tsconfigs like bz-frontend
  - ✅ inherit from tsconfig.base.json

- ✅ avoid react-grid-layout initial animation
  - ✅ initialWidth window.clientWidth + positionStrategy={absoluteStrategy} works

- ✅ can right click add grid item
  - ✅ UiGridContextMenu component
  - ✅ create item creates grid item

- ✅ fix multiple ttys
  - need different session
- ✅ ui items receive props.id i.e. `itemId`

- ✅ can remove grid item
- ✅ fix remove grid item bug
  - fix mobile via onPointerUp -> onPointerDown

- ✅ can reset layout from global
- ✅ force grid height full

- ✅ tty should use sessionKey not layoutId
  - ✅ ui context provides uiStore
  - ✅ every ui has respective meta `{ layoutId, uiKey }`
  - ✅ contextmenu can specify sessionKey
    - ✅ ui has optional uiInstantatiorRegistry
    - ✅ Jsh has entry in uiInstantatiorRegistry
    - ✅ contextmenu shows respective ui
    - ✅ bootstrap ui enforces non-existing sessionKey `tty-{n}`
  - ✅ unmount should remove uiConfig
  - ✅ persisted layout can contain partial ui instance meta

- ✅ avoid pinchzoom opening contextmenu

- ✅ popover confirm for ui close
- ✅ popover confirm for Global reset

- ✅ uis have schema validated in `<UiInstance>` inducing type of `props.meta`

- ✅ UiGrid supports tabs
  - motivation: hide Global on mobile; grouping; improve mobile layouts
  - ✅ basic instantiable ui/tabs with layout in schema
  - ✅ show contextmenu on click add tab
    - ❌ tried via external `Menu.trigger` but it broke main `ContextMenu.trigger`
  - ✅ can specify other uis in tab slots
  - ✅ clicking add tab adds ui to new tab
    - ✅ alerts mock
    - ✅ render ui's meta inside tab
  - ✅ ui.layoutId -> ui.id
  - ✅ by default uis have lowercased title `${uiKey}-${firstNaturalNumber}`
    - could change per ui but e.g. tty sessionKey already matches
  - ✅ tab has "break-out" button
    - in future replace with "drag outside"
    - ✅ can break out
    - ✅ issue maybe with stale layoutApi e.g. lack tabs ui?
      - works after hard-refresh
      - happens from empty tabs if add two Jsh tabs
      - seems fixed after  `id := meta.id` and use as dep
  - ✅ try use react-reverse-portal in each grid item
    - reparenting
    - ✅ defineUi ui takes optional portalNode and renders into it
    - all uis (ones in tabs too) have a portal in ui.store
    - ✅ UiInstance provides portalNode and renders out portal
  - ✅ break out tab should preserve portal
    - might need store after all
    - ✅ UiInstance stores in ui.store on mount, but does not remove on unmount
    - ✅ Delete tab removes portal
    - ✅ Delete UI removes portal
    - ✅ Delete tabs removes all sub-portals
    - ✅ re implement break out tabs
  - ✅ ui break out is still broken for Jsh and World
    - still fixed by refreshing
    - probably related to stale layoutApi
  - ✅ delete tab should delete portal too
  - wrap uiStore.setState inside uiStoreApi 

- ✅ redo portals
  - ✅ remove portal code
  - ✅ `uiStore.byId` with values `{portal,meta}`
  - ✅ move UiGrid's `toUi` to uiStore `toInitMeta`
    - initially provided meta pre-zod-parse
    - try use to initiate portals
  - ✅ mount uis in external portal container
    - ✅ listen to toInitMeta
    - ✅ ensure byId rather than in defineUi
    - ✅ fix initial rect
  - ✅ remove toInitMeta using byId only
    - initial meta should be parsed
    - unify `byId` and `toInitMeta`
  - ✅ On add item should parse meta and provide parsed or original to store.
  - ✅ uiStoreApi.addUis
  - ❌ UI has no props except id.
    - avoids need to refine UI props type.
    - ❌ too much bloat in each ui
  - ✅ UI in portal should parse meta too.
  - ✅ fix Tabs
    - need to create portal which is not auto-added to grid
    - ✅ `byId.meta.parentId` is undefined or tabsId
    - ✅ UiGrid does not render portals with parentId
  - ✅ fix overwrite uis on hmr
    - previously the last persisted uis were reverted to
    - currently continually tracking ui.store in layout.store uiLayout.toUi
    - alternatively could use a state variable in routes/index.tsx

- ✅ refactor layoutApi e.g. remove addItem

- ✅ merge layout.store into ui.store + persist (?)
  - ✅ ui.layout uses persist middleware
  - ✅ restore layout from ui.store
  - ✅ migrate rest of layout.store e.g. ready
  - ✅ remove layout.store

- ✅ packages/ui/world
  - ✅ create dummy package
  - ✅ add react-three-fiber
  - ✅ import and view gltf
    - debug via gltfjsx i.e. `pnpx gltfjsx TestBlockbench5.gltf`

- hmr issues
  - ✅ onchange ui.store sometimes lose layout
  - ✅ ui.store issue with context...
    - editing Tabs caused it to disappear
    - seems related to zustand ui.store hmr behaviour
      - even when only imported, not fed thru context
    - apparently fixed via preservation over hmr using `import.meta.hot.data.__ZUSTAND_STORE__`
  - ✅ can we avoid remount on edit ui.store?
    - preserve uiRegistry on hmr (similar to ui.store fix)

- ✅ move uiStoreApi.uiGrid to ref
- ❌ addUis supports opts.layoutItems
  - appendLayoutItems is now inside UiContext, not uiStoreApi
- ✅ uis have play/pause button tied to meta.disabled
