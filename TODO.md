# TODO

- ✅ start using `navcat`
  - ✅ add to `ui__world`
  - ✅ create a webworker which can send/receive
  - ✅ generate demo tiled navmesh in webworker
  - ✅ send via serialization

- ✅ construct `w.nav` and show on floor
  - ✅ extract triangles and draw in floor
  - ✅ send event which can be awaited (`nav-updated`)

- ✅ fix hmr onchange geomorphs.ts, const.ts and many others
  - ✅ fix `vite:hmr circular imports detected` (`pnpm dev --debug`)
  - ✅ `@npc-cli/ui-sdk` root only exports types
  - 🔔 issue arises from newly added webworker i.e. it references world/src/const.ts
  - ✅ fix is to send "layout instances" to webworker so it doesn't know about const.ts

- ❌ on edit `geomorph.ts` should rebuild assets and trigger update
  - move request nav worker message to `<WorldWorker>`

- ✅ do not cut doors out of navmesh
- ✅ vite-plugin-watch-assets recomputes assets.json

- ✅ improve HMR onchange tiled-navmesh config
  - ❌ can send config override message
  - ✅ handle hmr in world.worker.ts and inform `<WorldWorker>`

- ✅ support hmr `DerivedGmsData` e.g. can change gmData.tops.nonHull

- ✅ generate spritesheets for symbols reachable by some MapEdit file
  - ✅ `gen-assets-json` stores `assets.stratifiedSymbolNodes`
  - ❌ script `gen-starship-sheets` restricts to leaves in `assets.stratifiedSymbolNodes`
    - we cannot restrict to leaves: we need every symbol containing an "obstacle" polygon
  - ✅ find every non-flattened symbol containing an "obstacle" polygon
  - ✅ script `gen-starship-sheets` generates spritesheet data using `maxrects-packer`
    - ✅ migrate legacy `npc-cli/service/rects-packer.js`
  - ✅ supports multiple sheets (0-based)
  - ✅ sheets.json schema
  - ✅ write sheets.json

- ✅ `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` should also draw the spritesheets
  - ✅ sheets.json entries have sheetId
  - ✅ draw the spritesheets
  - ❌ find a way to restrict bridge--042 image size
    - more obstacles from it will be added
  - ✅ can `pnpm gen-starship-sheets --prod`
    - produces alternative "optimized" texture `.prod.{texId}.png` only drawing obstacle-covered-parts
    - PROD only: smaller download and still have decor cuboid "obstacles"
    - still wastes texture space (memory)

- ✅ MapEdit provide triangle `<path>` for console--019

- ✅ layout.obstacles have
  - ✅ `symbolKey` (string) of original unflattened symbol parent
  - ✅ `transform` for instancedMesh transform
  - ✅ `origSubRect` used to compute UVs
    - `origPoly.rect` offset by `(-bounds.x, -bounds.y)`
    - to compute UVs we'll also need `meta.symbolKey` to lookup `(sheetId, symbolImageCoords)`

- ✅ BUG map origin is not aligned to world origin

- ✅ symbol asset bounds should come from "top image node"
  - ✅ transform.{e,f} should not include offset when snap
    - ✅ confusing (dx, dy) for console--019
    - ✅ console--019 should have transform.{e,f} 0

- ✅ go through existing symbols and fix
- ✅ need symbol `office--001--2x2` instead of `console--019--2x2`
  - "apparent" alignment issues related to some symbol underlays having doors

- ✅ sometimes `Floor` and `Ceiling` fail due to unassigned or mismatched buffer attributes

- ✅ investigate symbol bounds
  - 🔔 clipping to underlay image bounds means outer part of doors not drawn in thumbnail
    - however provides better thumbnail alignment when laying out geomorphs
    - could even consider further restriction to gridRect
  - 🔔 seen symbol alignment improve on re-add symbol to 301
  - ✅ reflection of symbol takes account of node.offset
    - on reflect y/x-axis we negate x/y-offset
  - ✅ `createSymbolFromSavedFile` should not apply `node.offset` to geometry
  - ✅ check other symbols

- ❌ obstacle polygons should be clipped to image node's bounds
  - otherwise they'll be overlap in symbol spritesheet

- ✅ floor/ceiling textures per gmId not per gmKey
  - 🔔 continuous navmesh: cannot assume same triangles for distinct gmKey instances
  - ✅ draw floor as before but per gmId (ceil still per gmKey)
  - ✅ change NavMesh tile triangle test from gridRect to worldBounds
  - ✅ correctly computing triangles in different instances
  - ✅ for the moment let's override hull doorways with a rect
  - ✅ ceilings per gmId too
    - since using same quad as ceiling would need special attribute/uniform

- ✅ MapEdit: map: geomorph symbol not aligned
  - ✅ keep "the space at top" of 301
  - ✅ remove `node.offset` for hull symbols
  - ✅ add offset to respective `<image>` in map
  - ✅ fix it by changing how we compute mapDefs

- ✅ refactor Ceiling
  - ✅ own quad and attributes (don't use w.floor)
  - ✅ texture indexed by gmKey (needs attribute)
  - ✅ test by supplying new hull symbol geomorph

- ✅ fix missing obstacles
  - ✅ related to reflection
  - ✅ can fix via THREE.DoubleSide
  - ❌ fix without using it by flipping based on determinant

- ✅ obstacles
  - ✅ propagate e.g. `meta.y` from symbol into obstacles
  - ✅ hide unused obstacle quads
  - ✅ use textures
  - ✅ issue with triangular part of console capturing nearby chair
    - console--019--2x2
    - ✅ remove `--prod` from `gen-starship-sheets` and always restrict symbols.{texId}.png to obstacles polygons
  - ✅ clean
    - DataArrayTexture
    - `worldToSguScale * 5`

- ✅ BUG webgpu scene sometimes flickers initially and disappears
  - horrendous prod-only 
  - seems fixed by wrapping everthing in `<Suspense>`

- 🚧 currently must re-run `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` per obstacle polygon change
  - 🔔 triangle in `console--019--2x2` whose rect extension exposes part of a chair
  - maybe just automate this... we still avoid the "changing spritesheet problem"

- ✅ fix sporadic lighter/darker floor
  - ✅ avoid async re-draw (nav could be ready midway)
  - seems fixed via react-three-fiber `<Canvas flat>`
- can scroll through tabs on mobile
- default is not empty-map (although still exists)
- ensure multiple worlds work

- start generating documentation in README.md

- check glsl fallback e.g. incognito or force

- improve thumbnails
  - generate map thumbnails (currently blank)
  - clean symbol thumbnails
- do not recompute all symbols when only edit a hull symbol (DEV)
  - done in prod for hull-symbols
  - more generally use sub-stratification
- import `crowd` from `navcat/blocks` and `crowd.update(agents, navMesh, clampedDeltaTime)`
- can connect Tty to World
- BUG MapEdit asking to save draft changes onchange when there are no changes
- symbols can have optional door supported by instantiateFlatSymbol
  - e.g. office--001--2x2
- symbol can have optional wall supported by instantiateFlatSymbol
- BUG `drawGm` (Floor): "SWEEP" probably poly union issue
  - need repro e.g. move stateroom inside 301

## Long running

- ❌ sync navmesh recomputation with MapEdit
  - DEV edit symbol -> recompute assets.json -> refetch + change `w.hash` -> floor redraw
  - ❌ try await nav recomputation in world query
  - ✅ BUG: PROD webworker is refetching assets without changing it
    - need to send the localStorage drafts to webworker
  - transition needs thought


- 🚧 extend existing symbols with missing decor/obstacle
  - ✅ stateroom-012 🚧 ...
  - ✅ BUG thumbnail wrong for transformed decor: origin?
    - packages/app/public/symbol/stateroom--012--2x2.thumbnail.png

- ✅ sync symbols in other instances
  - symbol thumbnails driven by meta.localVersion updated on `assetsJsonChanged`
- drafts fighting: with 2 instances open for same file
- try deform limbs of blockbench model, saving as separate file
- move path parsing code out of vite plugin file, to support hmr
- warn if symbols "above" walls in symbol

- ✅ migrate to `node:util` parseArgs i.e. discard `getopts`
  - keep it for `@npc-cli/cli`

- 🚧 shell refinement
  - ✅ finish migrating semantics
  - ✅ provide `modules` so can `import util`
  - ✅ fix ctrl-C for `poll`
  - ❌ BUG `echo foo | map 'x\n=>x'`
    - technically string does not define a valid js function so is interpreted as a string
  - ✅ Tty has /etc/{util.sh,util.js.sh}
  - 🚧 STOP bug: appears initially in e.g. 3rd tty
    - seen profile fail to load too
  - ❌ improve `[undefined, undefined, undefined]` output of `call '() => document.documentElement.childNodes' | map Array.from | log`
  - sometimes on hot reload need to ctrl-c

- 🚧 future tabs
  - ✅ try make basic tabs components with draggable tabs
    - https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about
  - ✅ can drag between different tabs components
  - can drag into tabs from outer ui
  - can drag out of tabs to outside (not another tabs)
  - detect responsive tabs change and revert on return (?)
