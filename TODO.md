# TODO

- ✅ currently must re-run `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` per obstacle polygon change
  - 🔔 triangle in `console--019--2x2` whose rect extension exposes part of a chair
  - could automate this... we still avoid "changing spritesheet problem"
  - ✅ assets.json has number `hash.obstacles`
  - ❌ `pnpm gen-assets-json` triggers `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` onchange hash.obstacles
    - we'll keep `hash.obstacles` though
  - ✅ support `public/starship-symbol/masks`
    - used when drawing obstacle sprite-sheets
    - ✅ example of mask
    - ✅ in `pnpm gen-starship-sheets` we should account for masks
    - ✅ put restrict to obstacle polys under `--prod`
      - probably should run in a git hook
    - ✅ clean up gen code
    - ✅ run `pnpm gen-starship-sheets --prod` on commit or push
    - ✅ move invert colours to script
    - ✅ can trigger refresh in dev via tanstack query devtools

- ✅ avoid `<Obstacles>` flicker by only uploading to GPU once drawing finished

- ✅ try add shadow quad to skinnedMesh
  - ✅ can export quad as another SkinnedMesh and show
  - ✅ add parent root to Blockbench file: root -> skeleton-root -> ...
  - ✅ augment skinnedMesh geometry with quad so still only one mesh
  - ✅ clean

- ✅ ensure multiple worlds work
  - saw work on desktop
- ✅ can scroll through tabs on mobile
  - first attempt failed i.e. `overflow-x-auto` plus `shrink-0`
- ✅ can drop tab outside Tabs
- ✅ can move UIs inside Tabs
- ✅ unify menu styles
- ✅ default is not empty-map (although still exists)
  - defaultMapKey has value "small-map-0"

- ✅ support object-picking
  - ✅ read pixel on pointer down
  - ✅ mounting `<NPCs>` late seems to fix things?!
  - ✅ Putting `<Suspense>` directly around NPC component seems to fix it
    - `useTexture` took too long?
  - Delay MRT: may want different scene for object-pick e.g. no walls
    - MRT could still be useful for drag-select
  - ✅ Floor/Ceiling/Walls/Obstacles shader support objectPick uniform

- ✅ fix obstacles texture disappearing on remount stuff inside World.tsx
  - hot reload was resetting canvas width/height to 1

- 🚧 navmesh should account for doors
  - https://github.com/isaac-mason/navcat/blob/9a8379e05cc28bf842405df214271885046833d8/examples/src/example-doors-and-keys.ts#L201
  - https://github.com/isaac-mason/navcat/blob/9a8379e05cc28bf842405df214271885046833d8/blocks/generators/generate-tiled-nav-mesh.ts
  - ✅ make our own `generateTiledNavMesh` with own `buildNavMeshTile` which "marks door areas"
  - ✅ saw working in untransformed but maybe not transformed geomorphs
  - 🚧 better encoding of `(gmId, doorId)`
  - can run navQuery using queryFilter specifying door areas

- compute room polygons correctly i.e. need to include doors

- on add grid item to UiGrid can we try to use maximum available height and width?

- for doors try track "openess ratio" via persistent array on gpu

- minecraft skin templates
  - https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Skin#Templates

- change ui `Global` to `Layout`
  - remove theme toggle
  - option to group layout into a single Tabs
  - option to flatten layout (no Tabs)
  - option to reset layout to default layout
    - Tabs with `world-0`, `tty-0` and `layout-0`
  - layout schema and layouts.json
    - can CRUD in DEV
- why is boolean uniform `objectPick` being set as `1` after we drag world?
- fix precision in `assets.json`
- start generating documentation in README.md
- check glsl fallback e.g. incognito or force
- support deleting symbols/maps from MapEdit
- improve hull symbol thumbnail e.g. add room outlines
- improve map thumbnail (🔔 currently blank)
- do not recompute all symbols when only edit a hull symbol (DEV)
  - done in prod for hull-symbols
  - more generally use sub-stratification
- import `crowd` from `navcat/blocks` and `crowd.update(agents, navMesh, clampedDeltaTime)`
- can connect Tty to World
- BUG MapEdit asking to save draft changes onchange when there are no changes
- symbols can have optional door supported by instantiateFlatSymbol
  - e.g. office--001--2x2
- symbol can have optional wall supported by instantiateFlatSymbol
- BUG `drawGm` (Floor): "SWEEP" probably poly union issue
  - need repro e.g. move stateroom inside 301

## Long running

- 🚧 extend existing symbols with missing decor/obstacle
  - ✅ stateroom-012 🚧 ...
  - ✅ BUG thumbnail wrong for transformed decor: origin?
    - packages/app/public/symbol/stateroom--012--2x2.thumbnail.png

- saw mobile fail to load initially but works after component update
- fix remove bug i.e. next tab not set
  - need repro
- drafts fighting: with 2 instances open for same file
- try deform limbs of blockbench model, saving as separate file
- move path parsing code out of vite plugin file, to support hmr
- warn if symbols "above" walls in symbol

- 🚧 shell refinement
  - ✅ finish migrating semantics
  - ✅ provide `modules` so can `import util`
  - ✅ fix ctrl-C for `poll`
  - ❌ BUG `echo foo | map 'x\n=>x'`
    - technically string does not define a valid js function so is interpreted as a string
  - ✅ Tty has /etc/{util.sh,util.js.sh}
  - 🚧 STOP bug: appears initially in e.g. 3rd tty
    - seen profile fail to load too
  - ❌ improve `[undefined, undefined, undefined]` output of `call '() => document.documentElement.childNodes' | map Array.from | log`
  - sometimes on hot reload need to ctrl-c

- ✅ future tabs
  - ✅ try make basic tabs components with draggable tabs
    - https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about
  - ✅ can drag between different tabs components
  - can drag into tabs from outer ui
  - can drag out of tabs to outside (not another tabs)
