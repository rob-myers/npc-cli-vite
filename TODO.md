# TODO

- ❌ migrate existing character to Blockbench
  - head 128x128 (1x1) body 384x128 (3x1)
  - ✅ copy over npc texture svgs
  - ✅ head has texture
  - ✅ head and body have correct texture dimensions
    - body should probably be thinner
  - ✅ body has texture
  - ❌ has arms
    - can dup and flip
- 🚧 request third-party
  - https://www.fiverr.com/seanencabo/do-blockbench-models-and-animations

- ✅ can render UiInstanceMenu inside ui e.g. for Tabs

- ✅ towards MapEdit 1
  - ❌ try convert our SVG symbols into GLTF importable by Blockbench GLTF import plugin
    - Migrating from SVG symbols to Blockbench (free as opposed to BoxySVG)
    - ❌ test generate some valid Blockbench file
      - unclear format
      - https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench-plugins/tree/master/plugins
        - gltf import plugin didn't work
    - ❌ try generate OBJ file and import manually
      - import ignores groups i.e. flat
    - ✅ try programmatically generate gltf and import into blockbench
      - https://gltf-transform.dev/
      - ✅ one cuboid inside a group
      - `pnpm test-gltf-transform`
    - ❌ generate gltf with a texture
      - seem pretty hard if we follow gtlf-transform i.e. weird winding-order
      - instead, try to understand the format exported by blockbench i.e. `cube-exported-from-blockbench`
      - seems everything is stored in a base64-encoded buffer
      - ❌ try to decode that buffer
      - decided against this approach
  - ❌ try create a starship symbol in blockbench
    - inability to support references
  - ✅ add placeholder MapEdit ui
  - ✅ start migrating scripts for "extracting" and renaming starship symbols
    - ✅ towards get-pngs
    - ✅ `pnpm get-pngs root Symbols symbol-root` worked
  - ❌ sketch script to convert an SVG symbol e.g. capture some stuff
  - ❌ parse gltf into e.g. floor, walls, ceiling, cuboids, quads
    - 🤔 maybe can avoid by directly parsing Blockbench JSON
  - ✅ can add group ui
  - ✅ can edit group name
  - ✅ cannot drag node into descendent
  - ✅ when group selected added group should be child
  - ✅ adding group adds a respective <g>
  - ✅ can add rect
  - ✅ can edit group/rect/path name
  - ✅ selected rect has outline
  - ✅ can drag a rect
  - ✅ can resize a rect
  - ❌ can convert a rect into a path
  - ❌ unions of rects/paths is another path
  - ✅ in-browser SVG-based replacement of Boxy SVG editor
    - ℹ️ implement via svg
    - ℹ️ easier to import current files
    - ✅ mock up "tree + svg"
    - ✅ @atlaskit/pragmatic-drag-and-drop for inspector dragging
    - ✅ symbols tree (groups, rects) works properly

- ✅ migrate script to convert png to webp

- 🚧 MapEdit has image node
  - 🚧 provide some images
    - 🚧 symbolByGroup
  - 🚧 can create node type "image"
  - uses imageKey to get image

- ✅ fix diagonal resize: now covered by absolute?
- ✅ fix disabled toggle inside Tabs

- 🚧 shell refinement
  - ✅ finish migrating semantics
  - ✅ provide `modules` so can `import util`
  - ✅ fix ctrl-C for `poll`
  - ❌ BUG `echo foo | map 'x\n=>x'`
    - technically string does not define a valid js function so is interpreted as a string
  - ✅ Tty has /etc/{util.sh,util.js.sh}
  - 🚧 STOP bug: appears initially in e.g. 3rd tty
    - seen profile fail to load too
  - 🚧 improve `[undefined, undefined, undefined]` output of `call '() => document.documentElement.childNodes' | map Array.from | log`

- future tabs
  - try make basic tabs components with draggable tabs
    - https://atlassian.design/components/pragmatic-drag-and-drop/about
  - can drag between different tabs components
  - detect responsive tabs change and revert on return (?)
